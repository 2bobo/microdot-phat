# Font Tools

These Python scripts are a very basic illustration of the bit-twiddling and pixel wrangling needed to convert images for `microdotphat.font` and back again.

They only cover printable characters in the ASCII character set from 032 (space) to 255.

Similar techniques should work for the unicode characters scattered in this font.
